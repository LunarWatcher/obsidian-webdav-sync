# Changelog

## 0.0.5

### Fixed

* The modal buttons are now disabled during an upload. There should ideally be a progress bar as well, but the previous system provided no feedback at all, and this is required anyway.

## 0.0.4

### Added
* Safeguards for deleting everything, or nearly everything. Pushes deleting either everything, or everything outside the .obsidian folder is now hard blocked. It is left open as an option in the sync dialog, but it's default-enabled.


## 0.0.1 through 0.0.3

Initial version plus tweaks for the upload to the obsidian registry.
